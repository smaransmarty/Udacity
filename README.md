####Udacity CourseWork
This Repository contains all the course work done by me required 
for the completion of my Machine Learning Nano Degree

####Interesting Projects
##### P1:Boston Housing Price Prediction
SkLearn Boston Dataset

Used DecisionTree Regressor to predict Boston Housing Prices.
Learnt Model Evaluation and Validation 

##### Tensor Flow
Used SVM classifier to predict images if they are A-J .
Learnt that Shallow learning techniques do not scale when and hence need Neural Networks for huge datasets
Using 500000 samples on the NOT MNIST database of http://yaroslavvb.com/upload/notMNIST
